Due to covid, wearing a face mask is must to stay safe. As the country starts going through various stage of reopening, face mask Has become an important element of our daily lives to stay safe and socialize. So, it is an application which utilize a camera to detect if a person is wearing a mask or not. The approach to achieve this purpose using machine learning packages like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV and Scikit-learn. MobileNetv2 architecture is used for making easier and faster to deploy the model. This system can be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purpose due to the outbreak of covid-19. This project can be integrated with CCTV cameras and application in airports, railway stations, offices, colleges and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
